    	<p> The Boston Celtics are currently one of the top teams in the NBA. Lead by their fearles 25 year old Point Guard, Kyrie Irving, the Celtics are primed to make a run for the NBA championship this year. The team has veterans Al Horford, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes and Greg Monroe to teach a young batch of players with plenty of promise that include: Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart, Terry Rozier, Semi Ojeleye, Daniel Theis, Guershon Yabusele, Abdel Nader, and Shane Larkin. The team is currently without there best player, Gordon Hayward, due to a potentially season ending injury that occurred in the opening minutes of his first game with the team. The team is coached by the bright young mind of Brad Stevens, whom many regard as a top 3 coach in the sport. The team is then managed by former player Danny Ainge, one of the top executives in the game, and is owned by Wyc Grousbeck. </p>
