       	 <p> The Boston Celtics are a storied sports franchise that boasts the greatest number of championships in the history of the sport, with 17 titles spanning from 1957 to 2008. The team was founded in the year 1946 by a man named Walter A. Brown. Since then the Celtics have been through many phases, beginning with possibly the most dominant team ever assembled, which won 11 championships in the span of 12 years. That team was anchored by one the all time greatest players ever, Bill Russell. The next great Boston Celtics team was the Larry Bird lead team in the 80s. Together that team won 3 titles together and started a new era of basketball. The most recent Celtics Team to win a Championship is the 2008 Boston Celtics who were lead by Paul "The Truth" Pierce. This team ended the longest championship drought the organization has ever seen. The Boston Celtics play in the historical TD Garden which was rebuilt in 1995. Hanging in the rafters of the TD Garden are the championship banners as well as the retired numbers of 23 famous Boston Celtics players.</p>
